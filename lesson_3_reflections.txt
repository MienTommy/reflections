When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're pushing your work from another computer or if you're working on a team. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be conflicts when autobatically pulling changes. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you don't have access to the internet, say in an airplane, you would already have the updated list of commits so you can merge later with.
