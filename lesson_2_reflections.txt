What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
When we merge two branches, it connects two branches together. The head of each branch combine into one file. We represent it in the way the diagram does because that is the structure of the commits when merged. Commits made by coin will not be a parent of a commit made by master.
